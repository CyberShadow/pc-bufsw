# emacs-pc-bufsw
quick buffer switcher for Emacs according mru/lru order

This switches Emacs buffers according to most-recently-used/least-recently-used order that is similar to one that is often available in Windows or Linux PC applications. The main idea here is that a user chooses two key combinations like C-tab/C-S-tab that switch between buffers according to most or least recently used order. After the final choice is made the last selected buffer becomes the most recently used one.
